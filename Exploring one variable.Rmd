This is an R Markdown document that I used to learn Data Analysis from udacity which explorees one variable


```{r}
fbdata <- read.csv("https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/pseudo_facebook.tsv", sep = '\t')

```

Histogram of birthdays
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
names(fbdata)

qplot(dob_day,data = fbdata)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
